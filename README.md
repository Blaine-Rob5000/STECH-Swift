# Final Project for _Swift Programming

By Robin G. Blaine

## Synopsis

This is an app for iPhone (specifically, this version is for iPhone8 Plus) that presents a story and allows the user to make choices for the protagonist's actions that determine the outcome of the story.

*Motivation*

My motivations for this project were to recreate the excitement of the original Choose-your-own-Adventure books as a mobile app.

*Installation*

Currently the project is set up as an Xcode project.

*API Reference*

In the allotted time for the project, I was only able to implement a short story.

- The story is navigated by tapping on the options you wish the character to perform, reading the results, and continuing to make selections until a conclusion to the story is reached.

*Tests*

The story links have been thoroughly tested.

*Contributors*

Individuals who wish to contribute to the project are free to do so.
